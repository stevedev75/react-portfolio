# React Portfolio

## My motivation for this project was to re-build my professional portfolio using React.JS., with the assistance of "create-react-app" to scaffold many of the starter folders and files that were needed in my directory. 

#### I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of how to construct a portfolio with a static navbar with several tabs, a static footer, and dynamic page content using the technology built-in to React.JS. In addition, this was the first application I deployed to GitHub pages from the terminal.  

#### This application solves the problem of how to include dynamic elements using React.JS, to showcase my web development abilities in a unique way.

#### In this project, I learned the most about React.JS, and GitHub pages.

#### Please see the screenshot below for a preview of the UI:
